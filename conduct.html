            <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

            <hr>
            
            The following is a Code of Conduct for reviewers and participants of Semantics and Linguistic Theory (SALT), which is dedicated to fostering an inclusive and welcoming environment for all linguists. It describes expected behavior and outlines ways in which the organizers will address problems that arise.

            <h3>Unprofessional behavior</h3>

            <p>All conference participants must maintain professional integrity in their relationships and interactions with one another. </p>

            <p>All participants of SALT are subject to the LSA's <a href="https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/lsa-civility-policy">Civility Policy</a> which, among other things, prohibits harassment and prejudice.  “Participant” in this policy refers to anyone present at LSA events, including staff, contractors, vendors, exhibitors, venue staff, LSA members, and all other attendees.</p>
            
            <p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
              <ul>
                <li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination (related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, language, etc.);</li>
                <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following;</li>
                <li>Harassing photography or recording;</li> 
                <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events;</li>
                <li>Inappropriate physical contact;</li>
                <li>Unwelcome sexual attention;</li>
                <li>Advocating for, encouraging, or condoning any of the above behavior</li>
</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Inclusive behavior</h3>
            
            <hr>
            
            <h3>Enforcement</h3>

            <p>Participants who are asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

            <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep SALT a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>

            <p>Organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.</p>

            <p>Participants must follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities; people should follow these rules outside event activities too!</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Reporting</h3>

            <p>If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it to conference staff as soon as possible. Harassment and other violations of the Civility Policy reduce the value of our event for everyone. People like you make our scientific community a better place, and we want you to be happy here.</p>
