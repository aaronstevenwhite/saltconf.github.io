          <h2>SALTED: The SALT Equity &amp; Diversity Committee</h2>
            <p>
            SALTED is charged with helping make semantics and pragmatics more
            equitable and diverse. The committee was formed in 2020 and meets
            regularly to discuss and organize initiatives like its SALTED
            Workshop Series. More information is available in
            our <a href="mission.pdf">Mission Statement</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>SALTED has established a SALT Access and Inclusivity Fund. The fund will be used to pay honoraria for SALTED workshops; to fund SALTED Scholarships (see below); and to underwrite sign language translation and other accessibility-related costs at SALT conferences that need it. If you have the means, we would appreciate a contribution from you! We will be accepting donations on a rolling basis over <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/home">PayPal</a> (at saltsteering@gmail.com).

            <h2>SALTED Scholarships</h2>
            <h3>Coming Spring 2023!</h3>
            <p>
              SALTED is proud to announce the SALTED Scholarships. We will award at least two or three scholarships per year of at least $200 for travel and registration costs for SALT participants who cannot otherwise afford them. We will allocate scholarships based on need and usefulness (to the applicant and the semantics community), as determined on a case-by-case basis by the SALTED Scholarship Subcommittee. Eligible applicants include undergraduate or graduate students, or SALT participants who are un- or under-employed.
            </p>
