          <h2>SALTED: The SALT Equity &amp; Diversity Committee</h2>
            <p>
            SALTED is charged with helping make semantics and pragmatics more
            equitable and diverse. The committee was formed in 2020 and meets
            regularly to discuss and organize initiatives like its SALTED
            Workshop Series. More information is available in
            our <a href="mission.pdf">Mission Statement</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>SALTED has established a SALT Access and Inclusivity Fund. The fund will be used to underwrite sign language translation and other accessibility-related costs at SALT conferences that need it, and for travel scholarships to people from disadvantaged or underrepresented  to participate in SALT. If you feel like you have the means, we would appreciate a contribution from you! We will be accepting donations on a rolling basis over <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/home">PayPal</a> (at saltsteering@gmail.com).

            <h2>The SALTED Scholarship</h2>
            <h3>Coming Spring 2023!</h3>
            <p>
              SALTED is proud to announce the SALTED Scholarships. We will award at least two or three scholarships per year of at least $200 for travel and registration costs for SALT participants who cannot otherwise afford them. We will allocate scholarships based on need and usefulness (to the applicant and the semantics community), as determined on a case-by-case basis by the SALTED Scholarship Subcommittee. Eligible applicants include undergraduate or graduate students, or SALT participants who are un- or under-employed.

            <h2>The SALTED Workshop at SALT 32</h2>
            <h3>(Prestige) English as an Object and Meta-Language</h3>
            <p>
            (Prestige) English has traditionally served both as the object
            of study and medium of study for formal semantics worldwide. This
            workshop aims to discuss what issues may arise from this virtual
            hegemony and explore some alternative approaches. Led by a panel of
            experts, we will discuss questions such as the following: What
            impact has the focus on English had on scholars outside of the
            Anglophone world? What can be done to increase the representation of
            non-English languages and non-prestige dialects in semantic
            research, pedagogy, and scholarly publication?
            </p>
